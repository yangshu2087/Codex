# Task Analyzer

Provides task analysis and skill selection guidance.

## Skills Index

See **[skills-index.yaml](references/skills-index.yaml)** for available skills metadata.

## Task Analysis Process

### 1. Understand Task Essence [MANDATORY]

Identify the fundamental purpose beyond surface-level work:

| Surface Work | Fundamental Purpose |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "Fix this bug" | Problem solving, root cause analysis |
| "Implement this feature" | Feature addition, value delivery |
| "Refactor this code" | Quality improvement, maintainability |
| "Update this file" | Change management, consistency |

**Key Questions** [MUST answer before proceeding]:
- What problem are we really solving?
- What is the expected outcome?
- What could go wrong if we approach this superficially?

### 2. Estimate Task Scale

| Scale | File Count | Indicators |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Small | 1-2 | Single function/component change |
| Medium | 3-5 | Multiple related components |
| Large | 6+ | Cross-cutting concerns, architecture impact |

**Scale affects skill priority:**
- Larger scale: process/documentation skills more important
- Smaller scale: implementation skills more focused

### 3. Identify Task Type

| Type | Characteristics | Key Skills |
|------|-----------------|------------|
| Implementation | New code, features | coding-rules, testing |
| Fix | Bug resolution | ai-development-guide, testing |
| Refactoring | Structure improvement | coding-rules, ai-development-guide |
| Design | Architecture decisions | documentation-criteria, implementation-approach |
| Quality | Testing, review | testing, integration-e2e-testing |

### 4. Tag-Based Skill Matching

Extract relevant tags from task description and match against skills-index.yaml:

```yaml
Task: "Implement user authentication with tests"
Extracted tags: [implementation, testing, security]
Matched skills:
  - coding-rules (implementation, security)
  - testing (testing)
  - ai-development-guide (implementation)
```

### 5. Implicit Relationships

Consider hidden dependencies:

| Task Involves | Also Include |
|---------------|--------------|
| Error handling | debugging, testing |
| New features | design, implementation, documentation |
| Performance | profiling, optimization, testing |
| Frontend | coding-rules/references/typescript.md, testing/references/typescript.md |
| API/Integration | integration-e2e-testing |

## Skill Selection Priority

1. **Essential** - Directly related to task type
2. **Quality** - Testing and quality assurance
3. **Process** - Workflow and documentation
4. **Supplementary** - Reference and best practices

## Output Format

Return structured analysis with skill metadata from skills-index.yaml:

```yaml
taskAnalysis:
  essence: <string>  # Fundamental purpose identified
  type: <implementation|fix|refactoring|design|quality>
  scale: <small|medium|large>
  estimatedFiles: <number>
  tags: [<string>, ...]  # Extracted from task description

selectedSkills:
  - skill: <skill-name>  # From skills-index.yaml
    priority: <high|medium|low>
    reason: <string>  # Why this skill was selected
    tags: [...]
    typical-use: <string>
    size: <small|medium|large>
    sections: [...]  # All sections from yaml, unfiltered
```

**Note**: Section selection (choosing which sections are relevant) is done after reading the actual SKILL.md files.

## Metacognitive Question Design

Generate 3-5 questions according to task nature:

| Task Type | Question Focus |
|-----------|----------------|
| Implementation | Design validity, edge cases, performance |
| Fix | Root cause (5 Whys), impact scope, regression testing |
| Refactoring | Current problems, target state, phased plan |
| Design | Requirement clarity, future extensibility, trade-offs |

## Warning Patterns [MANDATORY to detect]

Detect and flag these patterns IMMEDIATELY:

| Pattern | Warning | REQUIRED Action |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Large change at once | High risk | MUST split into phases |
| Implementation without tests | Quality risk | MUST follow TDD |
| Immediate fix on error | Root cause missed | MUST pause and analyze with 5 Whys |
| Coding without plan | Scope creep | MUST plan first |

**ENFORCEMENT**: Detecting ANY warning pattern requires IMMEDIATE corrective action

## Common Decision Points

| Decision | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Need documentation? | Check documentation-criteria decision matrix |
| Which implementation approach? | Check implementation-approach phases |
| How to test? | Check testing + integration-e2e-testing |
| Code quality concerns? | Check ai-development-guide anti-patterns |
| Frontend specific? | Check coding-rules/references/typescript.md |
