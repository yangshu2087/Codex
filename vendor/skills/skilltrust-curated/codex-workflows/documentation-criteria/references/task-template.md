# Task: [Task Name]

Metadata:
- Dependencies: task-01 -> Deliverable: docs/plans/analysis/research-results.md
- Provides: docs/plans/analysis/api-spec.md (for research/design tasks)
- Size: Small (1-2 files)

## Implementation Content
[What this task will achieve]
*Reference dependency deliverables if applicable

## Target Files
- [ ] [Implementation file path]
- [ ] [Test file path]

## Investigation Targets
Files to read before starting implementation. Use concrete file paths, optionally with a section/function hint:
- [e.g., src/orders/checkout.ts (processOrder function)]

## Investigation Notes
Brief observations recorded after reading Investigation Targets:
- [path] - [interfaces, control/data flow, state transitions, side effects relevant to this task]

## Implementation Steps (TDD: Red-Green-Refactor)
### 1. Red Phase
- [ ] Read all Investigation Targets and update Investigation Notes
- [ ] Review dependency deliverables (if any)
- [ ] Verify/create contract definitions
- [ ] Write failing tests
- [ ] Run tests and confirm failure

### 2. Green Phase
- [ ] Add minimal implementation to pass tests
- [ ] Run only added tests and confirm they pass

### 3. Refactor Phase
- [ ] Improve code (maintain passing tests)
- [ ] Confirm added tests still pass

## Operation Verification Methods
(Derived from Verification Strategy in the work plan)
- **Verification method**: [What to verify and how]
- **Success criteria**: [Observable outcome that proves correctness]
- **Failure response**: [What to do if verification fails]
- **Verification level**: [L1/L2/L3, per implementation-approach skill]

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All added tests pass
- [ ] Operation verified per Operation Verification Methods above
- [ ] Deliverables created (for research/design tasks)

## Notes
- Impact scope: [Areas where changes may propagate]
- Constraints: [Areas not to be modified]
