```

### Data Contract

#### Component 1

```yaml
Input:
  Type: [Data shape, contract, or schema]
  Preconditions: [Required items, format constraints]
  Validation: [Validation method]

Output:
  Type: [Data shape, contract, or schema]
  Guarantees: [Conditions that must always be met]

Invariants:
  - [Conditions that remain unchanged before and after processing]
```

### Test Boundaries

#### Mock Boundary Decisions

| Dependency / Boundary | Test Level | Use Real Dependency | Isolation Method | Rationale |
|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
| [Repository / API / queue / hook] | [integration / e2e] | [Yes / No] | [mock / fake / local test env / browser harness] | [Why this boundary should behave this way in tests] |

#### Data Layer Verification Strategy

- Data storage involved: [Yes / No]
- Schema or model references: [table / collection / model names or N/A]
- Real verification approach: [container DB / dedicated test DB / in-memory adapter / browser fixture / N/A]
- Query and repository coverage: [How repository, ORM, or query paths will be verified]
- Migration compatibility check: [How schema drift will be detected or why N/A]

### Field Propagation Map (When Fields Cross Boundaries)

| Field | Boundary | Status | Detail |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| [field name] | [Component A to B] | preserved / transformed / dropped | [logic or reason] |

## Verification Strategy

Verification Strategy defines what correctness means and how to prove it at design time. L1/L2/L3 (from implementation-approach) define task-level verification depth at execution time.
Use the minimal form only when the change is low-risk or the verification path is self-evident. Otherwise fill all fields concretely.
Low-risk: changes affecting 1-2 files with no external contract, integration, or data-flow changes.
Self-evident: internal-only refactoring with identical observable inputs and outputs.

### Correctness Proof Method

- **Correctness definition**: [What "correct" means for this change]
- **Target comparison**: [What is being compared or validated against what]
- **Verification method**: [How correctness will be verified]
- **Observable success indicator**: [What observable result proves the verification succeeded]
- **Verification timing**: [`phase_1` | `per_phase` | `integration_phase` | `final_phase`]
- **Timing note**: [Optional free-text clarification when the enum alone is insufficient]

### Early Verification Point

- **First verification target**: [The smallest unit that proves the approach works]
- **Success criteria**: [Observable outcome that proves correctness]
- **Failure response**: [What to do if early verification fails]

### Output Comparison (When Changing Existing Observable Behavior, an External Contract, or a Persisted Data Shape)

- **Comparison input**: [Identical input used for both the current and new implementation]
- **Expected output fields**: [Specific fields, columns, or output format to compare]
- **Diff method**: [How the outputs are compared, such as field-by-field diff, file diff, or snapshot comparison]
- **Transformation pipeline coverage**: [Map each listed step from codebase analysis `dataTransformationPipelines` to the comparison that verifies its output. If a step passes data through unchanged, mark it excluded with rationale]

Mark as `N/A` with a brief rationale only when the change does not alter existing observable behavior, an external contract, or a persisted data shape.

### State Transitions and Invariants (When Applicable)

```yaml
State Definition:
  - Initial State: [Initial values and conditions]
  - Possible States: [List of states]

State Transitions:
  Current State -> Event -> Next State

System Invariants:
  - [Conditions that hold in any state]
```

### UI Error State Design (when feature includes frontend)

| Component / Screen | Loading | Empty | Error | Partial |
|-------------------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| [Component name] | [Skeleton / spinner] | [Empty state + CTA] | [Error message + Retry] | [Cached display + Banner] |

### Client State Design (when feature includes frontend)

| State Category | State | Management Method | Sync Strategy |
|---------------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| Server state | [Fetched data] | [Cache library / custom hook] | [Polling / WebSocket / manual refresh] |
| Local UI state | [Modal open, tab selection] | [useState / useReducer] | - |
| Temporary state | [Form input, draft] | [useState / form library] | [Auto-save / manual save] |

### UI Action - API Contract Mapping (when feature includes frontend)

| UI Action | API Endpoint | Request | Response | Error Contract |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|----------------|
| [Button click / form submit] | [POST /api/xxx] | [Request body fields] | [Response fields] | [Error codes and UI handling] |

### Error Handling

| Error Category | Example | Detection | Recovery Strategy | User Impact |
|---------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| [Validation / External / Infrastructure / Business logic] | [Specific error] | [How detected] | [Retry / Fallback / Propagate / Log-and-continue] | [User-facing message or silent handling] |

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Log events**: [Key events to log: state transitions, external calls, error occurrences, performance thresholds]
- **Log levels**: [Which events use DEBUG / INFO / WARN / ERROR]
- **Sensitive data**: [Fields to mask or exclude; align with Security Considerations]
- **Monitoring**: [Metrics to track, alert thresholds, dashboard requirements]

## Implementation Plan

### Implementation Approach

**Selected Approach**: [Approach name or combination]
**Selection Reason**: [Reason considering project constraints and technical dependencies]

### Technical Dependencies and Implementation Order

#### Required Implementation Order
1. **[Component/Feature A]**
   - Technical Reason: [Why this needs to be implemented first]
   - Dependent Elements: [Other components that depend on this]

2. **[Component/Feature B]**
   - Technical Reason: [Technical necessity to implement after A]
   - Prerequisites: [Required pre-implementations]

### Migration Strategy

[Technical migration approach, ensuring backward compatibility]

## Security Considerations

Evaluate the following for this feature's trust boundaries and data flow:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: What authentication is required for new entry points? What authorization checks protect resource access?
- **Input Validation**: Where does external input enter the system? How is it validated before processing?
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: What data requires protection (encryption, masking, access control)? What data is safe to include in logs and error responses?

Mark items as N/A with brief rationale when the feature has no relevant trust boundary.
